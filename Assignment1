#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

  	Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from initial conception to operation and maintenance. Software engineering is a discipline that involves applying engineering principles to the development of software. It is a systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software that ensures that the end product is of high quality, reliable, and meets the needs of the users. The goal of software engineering is to produce software that is efficient, easy to use, and easy to maintain. Software engineers also recognize that they must work within organizational and financial constraints, and they must look for solutions within these constraints.
Importance of Software Engineering in IT.
-	Efficient systems: IT relies heavily on software to manage and process vast amounts of data. Software Engineering ensures that IT systems are efficient, allowing organizations to make the most of their technology investments.
-	 System integration: IT environments often consist of various hardware and software components. Software Engineering helps in the seamless integration of these components, ensuring they work together harmoniously.

-	Disaster recovery: IT systems need to be resilient to unforeseen events. Software Engineering contributes to disaster recovery planning and the development of backup and restore mechanisms.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

1.	The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 NATO Conference)
Description: The term "software engineering" was first coined at the 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering in Garmisch, Germany. This conference was organized to address the growing complexity of software systems and the challenges of developing reliable and maintainable software.
It was significant as it focused on:
•	Recognition of Software as a Discipline:
The conference marked the formal recognition of software development as an engineering discipline, distinct from hardware engineering.
•	Focus on Best Practices:
It emphasized the need for systematic approaches, methodologies, and tools to manage the software development process.
•	Foundation for Future Development:
The discussions at the conference laid the groundwork for the development of software engineering principles, such as modularity, abstraction, and structured programming.

2.	The Emergence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s)
 Object-oriented programming became popular in the 1980s, introducing a new way of designing and building software systems. OOP is based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior together.
 Key Contributors: Alan Kay, often credited with coining the term "object-oriented programming," and Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, are key figures in this movement.
    Impact:
•	Improved Modularity and Reusability:
OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which improved code modularity and reusability.
•	Better Modeling of Real-World Systems:
OOP allowed developers to model real-world systems more effectively, making software design more intuitive and maintainable.
•	Foundation for Modern Software Development:
OOP became the foundation for many modern programming languages and frameworks, influencing software design patterns and practices.
•	Improved code reuse, scalability, and maintainability by organizing software around objects rather than actions.
•	Encouraged the use of design patterns and principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
•	Led to the development of popular programming languages like Java, C++, and Python, which are widely used today.

3.	The Agile Manifesto and Agile Methodologies (2001)
In 2001, a group of 17 software developers published the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centric development over rigid planning and processes. This led to the widespread adoption of Agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP).
   

Significance:
•	Shift to Iterative Development:
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promoted iterative development, allowing teams to deliver working software in small, incremental releases.
•	Focus on Collaboration:
Agile emphasized close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and customers, ensuring that the software met user needs.
•	Adaptability to Change:
Agile's emphasis on adaptability made it easier for teams to respond to changing requirements and market conditions.
•	Widespread Adoption:
Agile became the dominant approach to software development, influencing not only development practices but also project management and organizational culture.

Conclusion
	Structured Programming: Brought discipline to software development, leading to more readable, maintainable, and reliable code.
	Object-Oriented Programming: Changed the way software was conceptualized and constructed, promoting better design and code reuse.
	Agile Methodologies: Transformed software development processes, emphasizing adaptability, customer involvement, and iterative progress.
The following milestones have collectively shaped modern software engineering, influencing everything from programming languages and design patterns to development methodologies and project management practices.







List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 A Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC model is a simplified representation of a software process. It is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software. Each process model represents a process from a particular perspective and thus only provides partial information about that process. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software.

Provide a brief description of each phase.
Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis 
 Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is performed by the senior members of the team with inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys and domain experts in the industry. This information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas. Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the project is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks.
Phase 2: Defining Requirements 
 	The next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts and it is done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.
Phase 3: Designing the Product Architecture 
 The Design phase is all about building the framework. The development team is responsible for software engineering and outlines the software’s functionality and aesthetic. This ultimately results in the software product. The emphasis lies on outlining the software’s structure, navigation, user interfaces, and database design. This phase ensures that the software is user-friendly and performs its tasks efficiently. Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed. Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification. This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product. A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its communication and data flow representation with the external and third-party modules (if any). The internal design of all the modules of the proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the smallest of the details in DDS. 
The Design phase is the link between the software’s purpose (established in the Planning and Requirements Analysis phases) and its execution (defined in the coding or the building the product phase). It’s an essential step in creating software that works efficiently and provides an excellent user experience.
Phase 4: Building or Developing the Product 
 In this phase of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is performed in a detailed and organized manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle. Another key aspect of this phase is regular code reviews. Team members carefully examine each other’s work to identify any bugs or inconsistencies. These meticulous assessments uphold high code standards, ensuring the software’s reliability and robustness. This phase also includes preliminary internal testing to confirm the software’s basic functionality. Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code. Different high level programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP are used for coding. The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.
Phase 5: Testing the Product 
This phase is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. However, this stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS. Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding. The aim is to ensure flawless software operation before it reaches the end-users and even identify opportunities for enhancement. The testing process begins by setting clear parameters in line with the software’s requirements. This includes identifying the necessary software conditions, and outlining diverse scenarios to examine these conditions. This phase aids in creating an efficient testing strategy.
Phase 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance 
After crafting a product with precision, it’s time to present it to the users by pushing to the production environment. 
The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users. Sometimes product deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of that organization. The product may first be released in a limited segment and tested in the real business environment (UAT- User acceptance testing). The Deployment phase doesn’t signal the end, but rather a notable milestone. It signifies the shift from a project phase to a product phase, where the software begins to fulfill its purpose. Then based on the feedback, the product may be released as it is or with suggested enhancements in the targeting market segment. After the product is released in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.
Phase 7: Maintenance 
 	The maintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations. Maintenance tasks encompass frequent software updates, implementing patches, and fixing bugs. User support is also a crucial component, offering help and guidance to users facing difficulties with the software. The maintenance phase also considers long-term strategies, for instance, upgrading or replacing the software. This decision depends on the software’s lifecycle and technological progress.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Model
	Waterfall model is the Sequential development model. The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases. The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. In this waterfall model, the phases do not overlap. Each phase schedule for the tasks to be completed within a specified time period. The documentation and testing happen at the end of each phase, which helps in maintaining the quality of the project. Waterfall requires extensive documentation upfront, whereas Agile focuses on working software over documentation. Waterfall Model is suitable Ideal for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, where changes are unlikely to occur once development begins. It suits projects with a fixed budget and timeline.

Agile Model
	Agile methodology has an adaptive team which is able to respond to the changing requirements. Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software • Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months). The most important of the principles is customer satisfaction by giving rapid and continuous delivery of small and useful software. Agile uses adaptive approach where there is no detailed planning and there is clarity on future tasks only in respect of what features need to be developed. There is feature driven development and the team adapts to the changing product requirements dynamically. The product is tested very frequently, through the release iterations, minimizing the risk of any major failures in future. Agile is more flexible and adaptive to changes, while Waterfall is rigid and less accommodating to changes once the project has started. Agile typically delivers working software sooner due to its iterative nature, while Waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the project timeline. Therefore, best suitable areas for the agile model is projects where requirements are expected to evolve, or the market conditions are uncertain. It's beneficial for complex projects where stakeholder involvement and feedback are crucial for success.

Agile Model methodology Example
	Xtreme Programming (“XP”) methodology is based around the idea of discovering “the simplest thing that will work” without putting too much weight on the long-term product view.
It is a methodology that emphasizes values such as Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage and Respect, and prioritizes customer satisfaction over everything else. This methodology encourages trust by motivating developers to accept changes in customer requirements, even if they arrive during the latter stages of the development cycle. Teamwork is extremely important in XP, since, when there is a problem, it is solved by the whole team of managers, developers or customers, bringing them together to promote conversation and engagement and break down barriers to communication. They all become essential pieces of the same puzzle, creating a fertile environment for high productivity and efficiency within teams. In xtreme Programming, the software is tested from day one, collecting feedback to improve development. XP promotes activities such as pair programming, and with a strong testing component, it’s an excellent engineering methodology.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)	
  An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier.
Importance of IDEs;
i.	Accelerates development and delivery
Without an IDE interface, programmers must configure numerous development tools individually. By combining an IDE, developers may access the identical list of capabilities in one location, eliminating the need to often transfer between tools. Integration of development responsibilities more tightly also increases developer efficiency. No longer must programmers move between applications to complete tasks. In addition, the IDE’s tools and features assist programmers in organizing resources, preventing errors, and implementing shortcuts.
ii.	Encourages standardization
A group of software developers and DevOps engineers will stick to a standardized method of operations by working within the same development environment. If the integrated development environment (IDE) provides preset templates or if code libraries are shared across multiple individuals or teams working on the same project, one may enforce standards further. It also governs the development process, making it easier for programmers to collaborate and enabling recruits to get prepped quickly so they can start as soon as possible.
iii.	Improves code accuracy
Instead of working like a code editor, the IDE will do additional checks to guarantee that the code is error-free and enable users to compile the code so that they may execute it instantly. Whether one is a language-specific developer or not, this may save time and reduce the number of intermediary stages in any process.
iv.	Integration opportunities, thanks to the cloud
Cloud-based IDEs may interface with several open-source management solutions through plugins and application programming interfaces (APIs). Numerous open-source code management systems are often compatible with cloud-based IDEs. GitHub is a cloud-based code-sharing and version control application that enables users to build their workflows. 
Bitbucket is an additional code collaboration platform that many developers use in their tech stack; it connects with developers’ preferred cloud IDEs and provides users with limitless private repositories. It is versatile because it can import across CodePlex, Git, and Google Code.
v.	Automatically builds executables
Developers require a compiler to convert source code to an executable. The compiler turns source code into platform-specific machine code. Compilers and associated development tools, including debuggers and profilers, are generally included inside an integrated development environment (IDE). Most compilers are intended to operate with a particular IDE or editor. 
When constructing via the command line, makefiles may supply the compiler with instructions on constructing the executable. Many programmers prefer utilizing an integrated development environment (IDE) rather than makefiles because it gives all the necessary tools in a single location and avoids incompatibility concerns between multiple compilers and target systems.
vi.	Drives efficiency
Integrated development environments (IDEs) boost developer productivity, decrease installation time and accelerate development activities by keeping developers informed of the most current threats, best practices, and standardizing the development cycle so everyone can participate. They enable programmers to consider their actions in terms of the complete software development life cycle (SDLC) instead of a number of different activities.
Examples of IDEs;
•	Microsoft Visual Studio
Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for creating programs with graphical user interfaces and consoles. It also supports websites, web apps, online services, and Windows Forms and WPF applications. Visual Studio has a code editor that supports IntelliSense (the component for code completion) and code refactoring. Additional installed tools include an integrated debugger, a code profiler, a GUI designer, a web developer, a class designer, and a database schema designer.

•	Android Studio
Android Studio, the official Android IDE, offers the most straightforward tools for developing apps for all Android devices. Combining a configurable build system and a rapid build/deploy system enables developers to concentrate on creating feature-rich, high-quality applications and deliver promptly. Additionally, it offers an entirely free IDE.
•	Eclipse
Eclipse is among the most well-known integrated development environments (IDEs) for Java. It is a desktop program that runs on several platforms. Eclipse’s user interface is among its most compelling features. It also supports drag-and-drop capabilities. One may also perform a static analysis on your code. Additionally, it supports debugging and profiling.

Version Control Systems (VCS)
A version control system (VCS) or version control software automates the process of version control. It tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you do not have to manage file versions manually or with custom automation scripts. A version control system keeps a complete history of your code and other files, allowing you to return to a previous version if needed. 
A version control system (VCS) tracks every alteration to a file or set of files, enabling developers to journey back to earlier versions and collaborate seamlessly. Centralized version control systems (CVCS) streamline this process by housing all file versions on a single server.
Developers borrow a file to tweak, then return it with updates, all neatly stored and cataloged by the server. This method shines in its simplicity, offering a straightforward path for managing changes. On the other hand, DVCS doesn't just centralize files; it democratizes them. Every developer holds the entire project history locally, empowering offline work and facilitating a tapestry of branching and merging strategies. This flexibility is a boon for dynamic teams aiming to weave together multiple project threads without tangling them.
Whether centralized or distributed, version control is the cornerstone of efficient, cohesive software development. It safeguards progress, clarifies the past, and smooths the path forward, ensuring that every team member can contribute their best work towards crafting stellar software.

Importance of Version Control Systems;
Version control is important for keeping track of changes to code, files, and other digital assets. You should use version control software for all assets and development projects that multiple team members will collaborate on. 
i.	Improved Code Quality and Productivity
Version control systems contribute to the overall quality and productivity of a software development team. By providing an organized and structured approach to managing code changes, version control systems help developers avoid errors, conflicts, and mistakes. This, in turn, leads to higher code quality and fewer bugs in the final product. Additionally, version control systems streamline the development process, enabling developers to work more efficiently and deliver projects on time and within budget.
ii.	Improved Code Collaboration
Version control systems such as Git and SVN allow developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without the risk of conflicts. By enabling developers to branch off the main codebase, make changes, and merge them back in, version control systems facilitate collaborative coding efforts. This ensures that developers can work on different features or fixes independently without interfering with each other's work.
iii.	Code Organization and Collaboration
Version control systems play a crucial role in maintaining code organization within a project. By enforcing a structured approach to managing code changes, version control systems help developers keep track of different versions of the codebase. This level of organization is essential for ensuring that the project remains manageable and scalable as it evolves over time. Furthermore, version control systems enable developers to work on different features or fixes concurrently, speeding up the development process and improving overall efficiency.
iv.	Seamless Team Collaboration
One of the key advantages of version control is its ability to facilitate seamless collaboration among team members. By providing a centralized platform for storing and managing code, version control systems enable developers to work together on a project efficiently. Team members can easily review each other's code, provide feedback, and collaborate on solving issues or implementing new features. This level of collaboration fosters a sense of teamwork and camaraderie among developers, leading to a more productive and cohesive work environment.
v.	Efficient Change Tracking
With version control, developers can track changes to the codebase effectively. Every code modification is recorded, along with details such as who made the changes and when they were made. This level of transparency makes it easier for developers to understand the history of the codebase and identify the reasons behind specific changes. Additionally, version control systems allow developers to revert to previous versions of the code if needed, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or errors.
 Examples of Version Control systems (VCs)
•	Git
Undoubtedly the most widely used VCS today, Git reigns supreme for its distributed nature, flexibility, and powerful branching capabilities. It empowers developers to work offline, create independent branches for experimentation, and seamlessly merge changes. Git’s learning curve can be steeper compared to centralized systems, but its robust feature set and extensive community support make it a top contender for most projects.
•	Bitbucket
Bitbucket is a part of the Atlassian software suite, so it can be integrated with other Atlassian services including HipChat, Jira, and Bamboo. The main features of Bitbucket are code branches, in-line commenting and discussions, and pull requests. It can be deployed on a local server, data center of the company, as well as on the cloud. Bitbucket allows you to connect with up to five users for free. This is good because you can try the platform for free before deciding to purchase

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers?
 Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i.	Poor software quality and maintenance
Quality assurance is a crucial aspect of software engineering. Inadequate testing practices can lead to unreliable software and unsatisfied users. 
Employing manual and automated testing techniques, including unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing, can help identify and fix issues early in development.  Besides, it can be easily overcome by employing competent engineers with adequate technical knowledge.
ii.	Inadequate testing and debugging
Testing and debugging are essential aspects of software engineering. To make an application flawless or robust, it should be tested under various simulated environments. Testers must ensure an understanding of every bit of the code before taking up regression tests in complex applications. 
Recruiting a dedicated quality analysis team can help manage this problem. A quality analysis team is tasked with running, testing and debugging the code before handing it to clients. This would save time and also help the organization retain its clients.
iii.	Adapting to changing technology and industry trends
Software projects often face changing requirements due to evolving user needs or shifting market demands. This can disrupt development plans and impact project timelines. The difficulty in keeping up with trends in the global market often takes away the competitive edge resulting in the organization losing business. 
Employing agile methodologies can enable iterative development and enhance adaptability to changing requirements.
iv.	System Integration 
System integration as a software development challenge, involves connecting different software systems or components to work together seamlessly. To deal with this issue, consider implementing robust APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to streamline communication between disparate systems.  
They design flexible architectures that support interoperability and data exchange between systems, ensuring compatibility and consistency across the integrated environment. Moreover, they conduct thorough testing and validation to identify and resolve integration issues early in the development process.
v.	Communication & Collaboration 
Communication and collaboration are vital in software development but can be challenging due to dispersed teams or miscommunication. An expert mobile app development company addresses this by implementing robust communication channels like Slack or Microsoft Teams, enabling real-time messaging and video conferencing.  
They utilize collaboration tools task management, ensuring transparency and accountability. Regular stand-up meetings, sprint retrospectives, and continuous feedback loops foster collaboration and alignment among team members. By emphasizing open and effective collaboration practices, the company ensures that project objectives are achieved.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

i.	Unit Testing
Unit testing is the first level of testing and is often performed by the developers themselves. It is the process of ensuring individual components of a piece of software at the code level are functional and work as they were designed to. Developers in a test-driven environment will typically write and run the tests prior to the software or feature being passed over to the test team. Unit testing can be conducted manually, but automating the process will speed up delivery cycles and expand test coverage. Unit testing will also make debugging easier because finding issues earlier means they take less time to fix than if they were discovered later in the testing process. 
ii.	Integration Testing
After each unit is thoroughly tested, it is integrated with other units to create modules or components that are designed to perform specific tasks or activities. These are then tested as group through integration testing to ensure whole segments of an application behave as expected (i.e, the interactions between units are seamless). These tests are often framed by user scenarios, such as logging into an application or opening files. Integrated tests can be conducted by either developers or independent testers and are usually comprised of a combination of automated functional and manual tests.
iii.	System Testing
System testing is a black box testing method used to evaluate the completed and integrated system, as a whole, to ensure it meets specified requirements. The functionality of the software is tested from end-to-end and is typically conducted by a separate testing team than the development team before the product is pushed into production.
iv.	Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing is the last phase of functional testing and is used to assess whether or not the final piece of software is ready for delivery. It involves ensuring that the product is in compliance with all of the original business criteria and that it meets the end user’s needs. This requires the product be tested both internally and externally, meaning you’ll need to get it into the hands of your end users for beta testing along with those of your QA team. Beta testing is key to getting real feedback from potential customers and can address any final usability concerns.

   Importance in Software QA
i.	Reliability: Ensures the software functions correctly under different conditions and is reliable over time.
ii.	Early Defect Detection: Helps identify and fix defects early in the development cycle, reducing costs and time spent on fixing issues later.
iii.	Risk Mitigation: By thoroughly testing each aspect of the software, potential risks are identified and mitigated before the software is deployed.
iv.	Compliance: Helps ensure the software adheres to industry standards, legal requirements, and contractual obligations.
v.	User Satisfaction: Ensures that the final product meets user expectations and requirements, leading to higher satisfaction and fewer post-deployment issues.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs. Generative AI requires detailed instructions to create high-quality and relevant output. In prompt engineering, you choose the most appropriate formats, phrases, words, and symbols that guide the AI to interact with your users more meaningfully. Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. AI technologies attempt to mimic human intelligence in nontraditional computing tasks like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and translation.

    Importance;
i.	Greater developer control
Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. They help the AI refine the output and present it concisely in the required format. They also prevent your users from misusing the AI or requesting something the AI does not know or cannot handle accurately. For instance, you may want to limit your users from generating inappropriate content in a business AI application.
ii.	Increased flexibility
Higher levels of abstraction improve AI models and allow organizations to create more flexible tools at scale. A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns. Organizations can rapidly reuse the prompts across the enterprise to expand their AI investments.
For example, to find opportunities for process optimization, the prompt engineer can create different prompts that train the AI model to find inefficiencies using broad signals rather than context-specific data. The prompts can then be used for diverse processes and business units.
iii.	Improved user experience
Users avoid trial and error and still receive coherent, accurate, and relevant responses from AI tools. Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data. Also, it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input. For example, requests to summarize a legal document and a news article get different results adjusted for style and tone. This is true even if both users just tell the application, "Summarize this document."

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt: "Write some code with strings in Python."
A clear, specific and concise prompt: Write a Python function called reverse string that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, if the input is 'Hello', the output should be 'olleH'."
Explanation: The improved prompt is more focused unlike the vague prompt that is open-ended and cannot give the AI a clear instruction to discuss and provide the clear aspect of using strings and prompting a python program on reverse strings.
